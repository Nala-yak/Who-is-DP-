### About Me ðŸ˜„
I am a newcomer in CTS College in Trinidad and Tobago, currently enrolled in the BSc I.T Programme. I am self-employed, currently making juice and sells it to other companies (not nationwide as yet). I have the basic knowledge in programming and web development and are currently learning more. I enjoy my current job but are also looking for another job within my field of expertise.

Elaborating a bit about my personal hobbies; I enjoy editing clips, graphic designing as well as chatting with AI (Artifical Intellligence) to assist me with tasks and learn about topics I don't know much about. I enjoy making music and listening to music to get ideas for new songs as well as educational and rock music. My top priority right now is making it to 1000 subscribers on YouTube: [Anime Content 4 U - click here to see channel](https://youtube.com/@animecontent4u18?si=nQgN6GwVQ8QnZVhi) 

In my spare time, I review things I've learned and indulge in my hobbies, researching more about things I like, related to my hobbies. My goal is to be a YouTuber and a Business Owner!

#### I'll add more stuff soon...
